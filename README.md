<p id="description">

<b>CREATING A VIRTUAL ENVIRONMENT IN VS-CODE IS RECOMMENDED </b>

MAIN CODE FILE: **'ShoppingCart.py'** 

TEXT FILE FOR STORING USER'S INFORMATION: **'users.txt'** 

We've went with the following idea: 
1. The shopping history is shown on the terminal right after you checkout and will stay there even if you logout and login again it is only removed if you kill the terminal .
2. The login functionality works as long as the user's information is present in the **'users.txt'** file like it should which helps user create a new shopping history.
3. We've kept the product's quantity limited as we want the admin's adding product functionality to have a purpose.
4. The products return to their original amount of quantity only if you re-run the code not if you only log-out and log back in

5. **ADMIN USERNAME AND PASSWORD**
1) Admin Username: **admin1** 
2) Admin Password: **Admin@123** 
(Details for admin shows up each time you run the application in the **'users.txt'** text file I've still given you the username and password above which are the only two necessary things for it</p>
